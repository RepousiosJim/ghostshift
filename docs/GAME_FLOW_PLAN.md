## Save Data Structure

```javascript
{
  credits: 0,
  totalRuns: 0,
  bestTime: null,           // Overall best time
  bestTimes: {},             // Per-level best times
  unlockedLevels: [0],      // Array of unlocked level indices
  perks: { speed: 1, stealth: 1, luck: 1 },
  settings: { 
    audioEnabled: true,
    masterVolume: 0.8,
    effectsQuality: 'high',
    fullscreen: false,
    reducedMotion: false
  },
  lastPlayed: null,
  totalCreditsEarned: 0
}
```

## Audio System (Phase 3)

The SFXManager provides procedural audio using Web Audio API:
- **alert()**: Detection warning
- **win()**: Mission success melody
- **fail()**: Mission failure sound
- **collect()**: Item pickup
- **select()**: Menu selection
- **menuHover()**: Menu hover feedback
- **pickup()**: General pickup
- **detection()**: Detection pulse (new)
- **restart()**: Level restart sound (new)
- **click()**: Button click feedback (new)

All sounds respect the master volume and audio enabled settings.
